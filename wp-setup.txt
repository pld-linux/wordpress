    Customizing WordPress plugins and themes
    in a default installation from PLD package.

			    Pawel Wilk <siefca@gnu.org>

Some  WordPress plugins  need customization  by editing  PHP
files  via web  interface.  Maybe there  are  also some  CSS
styles and/or theme  files you would like to  edit that way.
However,  in default  PLD  installation  (from RPM  package)
all  these files  (plugins and  themes and  their respective
directories) are writable only by their owner, which is root
user. Additionaly the group which owns the files is a group,
which web server  uses by default (http), but  the files and
directories are only readable (searchable) by this group.

If you would  like to customize your WordPress  site via the
Web  you should  first let  the  owning group  to write  the
files. You can  set it up by  invoking: /usr/bin/wp-setup or
./wp-setup.sh in your WordPress directory.

When you finish you may want to revoke the ability to change
by  calling:  /usr/bin/wp-secure  or ./wp-secure.sh  in  the
WordPress default installation directory.

This  simple routine  is  highly recommended  when you  have
multiple dynamic  sites running  under the  same parmissions
and avoids  bad users  to overwrite  your content  files via
nasty server-side scripts.
